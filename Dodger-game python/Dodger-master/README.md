Space Invaders sorta game with pygame:

This game requires python 2.7 and pygame 1.9

For a windows 7 64bit of pygame look here

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

Linux versions can be compiled from source on pygame.org

An RPM package is available but requires dependencies (surprise)

The Debian package has 2 bugs. 

And I don't have a FreeBSD machine anymore so I don't know.
